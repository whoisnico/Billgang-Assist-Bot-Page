2) Before you can start with the setup you have to get your Billgang API Token & Shop ID. [Click here to get to your token & shop id](https://dash.billgang.com/developers/api-keys)
3) Now you can start with the setup! Use `/setup` and insert the Billgang API token & ShopID. (Nobody will see this command & the response and therefore your token will not be seen by other users)
4) Now the bot is ready to make your life on your Discord server easier.
5) (Optionally) With `/set_customerrole` you can give your users the possibility to claim the customer role after a purchase
